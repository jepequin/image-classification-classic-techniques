# Identification of Cracks and Potholes using classical Machine Learning Techniques
This if the final project for the course Supervised Machine Learning : Classification, by Coursera (www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification). The goal of this project is to train several classical machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of cracks and/or potholes in road images.

## Description
Poor road condition affects traffic safety. By capturing road information and images, identification of problems and later intervention are made possible. In this project we use a dataset containing images of defects in asphalted roads in Brazil; these roads can contain cracks, potholes, or no defects at all. This dataset consists of 2235 samples of roads where each image include 2 masks that delimit the crack and pothole defects. Using classical machine learning techniques
- Logistic Regression,
- Support Vector Machines,
- Ensemble Classifiers,

we produce a pipeline for automatic defect detection. 

We explore dimensionality reduction techniques (Histogram Of Gradients [2]) as a preprocessing step for some of the models. We also search through the parameter space to determine the best performing classifiers.
